# Citibike Analysis
Data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
Code: Python

Citibikes are such an ingrained part of NYC transportatio system and is the largest bikesharing system in America, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations. I had seen a youtube video of Casey Neistat discussing Citibikes and comparing it with other NYC transporation so when I saw that Citibike had extensive data on their website about every ride ever taken, I decided to analyze it. Biking is a great form of exercise so through this analysis I wanted to understand how and if Citibikes encourage exercise and being more active.

Unsurprisingly, each file is very large with millions of rows so I chose to analyze bike rides in June 2023. I chose June because its when the weather is better and more people are riding bikes and being active
