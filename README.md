# Citibike Analysis
Data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
Code: Python

Citibikes are such an ingrained part of NYC and I had seen a youtube video of Casey Neistat discussing Citibikes and comparing it with other NYC transporation so when I saw that Citibike had extensive data about every ride ever taken I decided to analyze it. Biking is a great form of exercise so through this analysis I wanted to understand how and if Citibikes encourage exercise and being more active.
