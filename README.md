# Citibike Analysis
Data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html

Code: Python

Citibike is the largest bikesharing system in America and such an ingrained part of NYC's public transportation system, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations. Biking is a great form of exercise so through this analysis I wanted to understand how and if Citibikes encourage users to be more active.

Unsurprisingly, each file is very large with millions of rows so I chose to analyze bike rides in June 2023. I chose June because its when the weather is better and more people are riding bikes and being active.
