# Citibike Analysis
Data: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html

Code: Python

with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations, Citibike is the largest bikesharing system in America and is such an ingrained part of NYC's public transportation system as it mkes travelling in NYC more effecient and easy, as well as being better for the planet. Biking is also such a great form of exercise so through this analysis I wanted to understand how and if Citibikes encourage users to be more active.

Unsurprisingly, each file is very large with millions of rows so I chose to analyze bike rides in June 2023. I chose June because its when the weather is better and more people are riding bikes and being active.
